        <h2>Alan Gilbert</h2>
        <h4>CONDUCTOR <br><br>New York Philharmonic Music Director Alan Gilbert began his tenure in September 2009. The first native New Yorker to hold the post, he has sought to make the Orchestra a point of pride for the city and country. As The New Yorker wrote, “Gilbert has made an indelible mark on the orchestra’s history and that of the city itself.”
<br>
Mr. Gilbert and the Philharmonic have forged artistic partnerships, introducing the positions of The Marie-Josée Kravis Composer-in-Residence and The Mary and James G. Wallach Artist-in-Residence — held in the 2015–16 season by Esa-Pekka Salonen and bass-baritone Eric Owens, respectively — as well as Artist-in-Association, currently held by pianist Inon Barnatan, who inaugurated the role in the 2014–15 season; an annual festival, which this season is Rachmaninoff: A Philharmonic Festival, featuring pianist Daniil Trifonov; CONTACT!, the new-music series; and the NY PHIL BIENNIAL, an exploration of today’s music by a wide range of contemporary and modern composers. During his tenure the Philharmonic launched the New York Philharmonic Global Academy, collaborations with partners worldwide offering training of pre-professional musicians, often alongside performance residencies; partners to date include the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra and Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Santa Barbara’s Music Academy of the West, and Rice University’s Shepherd School of Music.
<br>
In the 2015–16 season Alan Gilbert conducts the New York Philharmonic in R. Strauss’s Ein Heldenleben to welcome newly appointed Concertmaster Frank Huang; Carnegie Hall’s Opening Night Gala; World Premieres by Esa-Pekka Salonen, Magnus Lindberg, Franck Krawczyk, William Bolcom, and Marc Neikrug; Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde; works by Sibelius in celebration of his 150th anniversary; and an all-Mozart program. He also co-curates the second NY PHIL BIENNIAL — during which he will conduct the World Premiere of Bolcom’s Trombone Concerto, a Philharmonic co-commission, as well as the Salonen premiere and a work by Per Nørgård, the second recipient of The Marie-Josée Kravis Prize for New Music at the New York Philharmonic, an honor introduced during Alan Gilbert’s tenure. The Music Director will perform on the violin alongside Philharmonic principals and Mr. Barnatan in Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time at The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Temple of Dendur as part of the Philharmonic’s Messiaen Week. Alan Gilbert and the Philharmonic launch a five-year partnership with the University Musical Society at the University of Michigan. Under the New York Philharmonic Global Academy, he will lead the Orchestra in its second performance residency through the Shanghai Orchestra Academy and Residency Partnership and make his second appearance conducting the Academy Festival Orchestra as part of the partnership with Santa Barbara’s Music Academy of the West.
<br>
Last season’s highlights included a staging of Honegger’s Joan of Arc at the Stake featuring Oscar winner Marion Cotillard; the U.S. Premiere of Unsuk Chin’s Clarinet Concerto, a Philharmonic co-commission, alongside Mahler’s First Symphony; the Verdi Requiem; three World Premieres; works by contemporary Nordic composers during CONTACT!; the Silk Road Ensemble and Yo-Yo Ma’s 15th-anniversary celebration; the conclusion of The Nielsen Project, the multi-year initiative to perform and record the Danish composer’s symphonies and concertos; and the EUROPE / SPRING 2015 tour. In August 2015 he led the Mahler Chamber Orchestra in the U.S. Stage Premiere of George Benjamin’s Written on Skin, co-presented by the New York Philharmonic and Lincoln Center as part of the Lincoln Center–New York Philharmonic Opera Initiative. High points of Mr. Gilbert’s first five Philharmonic seasons include the critically celebrated productions of Ligeti’s Le Grand Macabre (2010) and Janáček’s The Cunning Little Vixen (2011) — both cited as the top cultural events of their respective years — as well as Philharmonic 360 at Park Avenue Armory (2012), the acclaimed spatial music program featuring Stockhausen’s Gruppen, and A Dancer’s Dream: Two Works by Stravinsky (2013, and later presented in movie theaters internationally). Other highlights include the inaugural NY PHIL BIENNIAL; a staged production of Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd starring Bryn Terfel and Emma Thompson that was broadcast on Live From Lincoln Center, earning Mr. Gilbert a 2015 Emmy nomination for Outstanding Music Direction; World Premieres of works by Magnus Lindberg, Christopher Rouse, John Corigliano, John Adams, and composers featured on CONTACT!; the score from 2001: A Space Odyssey as the film was screened; Mahler’s Second Symphony, Resurrection, on A Concert for New York on September 10; Mr. Gilbert’s Philharmonic debut as violin soloist in J.S. Bach’s Concerto for Two Violins; five concerts at Carnegie Hall; and nine tours around the world.
<br>
Conductor laureate of the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and principal guest conductor of Hamburg’s NDR Symphony Orchestra, he regularly conducts leading orchestras nationally and internationally, such as the Boston Symphony Orchestra, The Philadelphia Orchestra, Amsterdam’s Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Berlin Philharmonic, Munich Philharmonic, Leipzig’s Gewandhaus Orchestra, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Orchestra della Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, and Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France. He has appeared at The Metropolitan, Los Angeles, Zurich, Royal Swedish, and Santa Fe opera companies. This season Mr. Gilbert makes debuts with four great European orchestras — Filarmonica della Scala, Dresden Staatskapelle, London Symphony, and Academy of St Martin in the Fields — and returns to The Cleveland Orchestra and Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra.
<br>
In September 2011 Alan Gilbert became Director of Conducting and Orchestral Studies at The Juilliard School, where he is also the first holder of Juilliard’s William Schuman Chair in Musical Studies. He made his acclaimed Metropolitan Opera debut in 2008 leading John Adams’s Doctor Atomic; the DVD and Blu-ray of this production received the 2012 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording. Renée Fleming’s recent Decca recording Poèmes, on which he conducted, received a 2013 Grammy Award. Earlier releases garnered Grammy Award nominations and top honors from the Chicago Tribune and Gramophone magazine.
<br>
Mr. Gilbert studied at Harvard University, The Curtis Institute of Music, and Juilliard and was assistant conductor of The Cleveland Orchestra (1995–97). In May 2010 he received an Honorary Doctor of Music degree from Curtis, and in December 2011 he received Columbia University’s Ditson Conductor’s Award for his “exceptional commitment to the performance of works by American composers and to contemporary music.” In 2014 he was elected to The American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and he received a 2015 Foreign Policy Association Medal for his commitment to cultural diplomacy. </h4>

        <h2>Susan Graham</h2>
        <h4>MEZZO-SOPRANO <br><br>Grammy Award–winning mezzo-soprano Susan Graham achieved international stardom within a few years of her professional debut. Her operatic roles span four centuries, from Monteverdi’s Poppea (L’incoronazione di Poppea) to Jake Heggie’s Sister Helen Prejean (Dead Man Walking), written especially for her, and her recital repertoire is equally wide-ranging. As one of today’s foremost interpreters of French vocal music, the Texas native was awarded the French government’s Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur. Ms. Graham enjoyed early success in “trouser” roles before mastering more virtuosic parts and title roles. She created the female leads in The Metropolitan Opera’s premiere productions of John Harbison’s The Great Gatsby and Tobias Picker’s An American Tragedy. Her discography features oratorios and song cycles by Berlioz, Ravel, and Chausson, as well as solo albums including her Grammy-winning recording of Ives songs. Among her additional honors are being named Musical America’s Vocalist of the Year and receiving an Opera News Award. She also collaborates frequently with pianist Malcolm Martineau. Susan Graham kicked off the 2015–16 season with a solo recital in Washington, D.C., and a concert with Mercury Baroque in Houston. She then returns to the Met as Countess Geschwitz in a new production of Berg’s Lulu by artist-director William Kentridge, and for a revival of Johann Strauss II’s Die Fledermaus as Prince Orlovsky. European concert dates include Britten at Teatro Real Madrid and recitals at London’s Wigmore Hall, Glasgow’s Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and the Vienna Konzerthaus. In the United States, Susan Graham appears with the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra in San Francisco, with Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony, at the Celebrity Series of Boston, and with Orchestra of St. Luke’s at Carnegie Hall, as well as with the New York Philharmonic. The mezzo-soprano later returns to Carnegie Hall to headline the program Susan Graham & Friends.</h4>

        <h2>Inon Barnatan</h2>
        <h4>PIANO <br><br> Pianist Inon Barnatan has been named as the New York Philharmonic’s first Artist-in-Association, a major three-season appointment highlighted by multiple concerto and chamber collaborations with the orchestra. Equally commanding in solo and chamber performances, Inon Barnatan, an Avery Fisher Career Grant recipient, has performed with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Cleveland and Philadelphia Orchestras, Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, Berlin’s Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester, Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, and the San Francisco, Jerusalem, and Shanghai symphony orchestras. He has worked with such conductors as Roberto Abbado, James Gaffigan, Matthias Pintscher, David Robertson, Edo de Waart, and Pinchas Zukerman.

Passionate about contemporary music, last season Mr. Barnatan premiered new pieces composed for him by Pintscher and Sebastian Currier. In his second season as the New York Philharmonic’s Artist-in-Association, in 2015–16 he performs concertos by Mozart and Beethoven, including as part of the Philharmonic’s residency partnership with the University Musical Society at the University of Michigan; appears on the annual New Year’s Eve concert; and performs Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time alongside Alan Gilbert on violin and Philharmonic principal musicians at The Metropoltian Museum of Art’s Temple of Dendur. Other season highlights include his Disney Hall debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, led by Gustavo Dudamel, and a U.S. tour with the San Francisco Symphony, led by Michael Tilson Thomas, featuring appearances at the Kennedy Center and Carnegie Hall.

 Mr. Barnatan’s discography includes Avie and Bridge recordings of Schubert’s solo piano works, as well as Darknesse Visible, which was included on The New York Times’s “Best of 2012” list. His Chopin and Rachmaninoff duo sonatas album, recorded with cellist Alisa Weilerstein, will be released by Decca Classics next season. Born in Tel Aviv in 1979, Inon Barnatan started piano at the age of three and made his orchestral debut at eleven. His studies have connected him to past distinguished pianists and teachers: he studied with Professor Victor Derevianko (a student of Heinrich Neuhaus); continued studies with Maria Curcio (a student of Artur Schnabel) and Christopher Elton at London’s Royal Academy of Music; and has since studied with and been mentored by Leon Fleisher.</h4>

        <h2>Makoto Ozone</h2>
        <h4>PIANO <br><br>Pianist Makoto Ozone taught himself to play the organ while very young, made his first television appearance at six, began performing regularly on Osaka Mainichi Broadcasting, and, after attending an Oscar Peterson concert at 12, turned his attention toward jazz piano. He moved to the United States in 1980 to study at Boston’s Berklee College of Music, and graduated at the top of his class in 1983 — the same year he gave a solo recital at Carnegie Hall and became the first Japanese musician to sign an exclusive contract with CBS. He has recently explored classical repertoire with conductors including Alan Gilbert, Charles Dutoit, Thomas Zehetmair, Joseph Swensen, Alexandre Rabinovitch, Arie van Beek, Francois-Xavier Roth, Tadaaki Otaka, Eiji Oue, and Michiyoshi Inoue. He has played Gershwin, Bernstein, Mozart, Beethoven, Rachmaninoff, and Shostakovich with the NDR Symphony Orchestra, Orchestre de chambre de Paris, Orchestre d’Auvergne, Sinfonia Varsovia, and the NHK Symphony Orchestra. He has worked with numerous other jazz artists including Gary Burton, Chick Corea, Paquito D’Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, Branford Marsalis, Jeff “Tain” Watts, Christian McBride, Dave Weckl, and Mike Stern. He is a regular guest of classical music festivals including the Festival de la Roque d’Anthéron in France and La Folle Journée in Nantes and Japan. Makoto Ozone made his New York Philharmonic debut in February 2014 on the ASIA / WINTER 2014 tour performing Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue, led by Music Director Alan Gilbert, in Seoul, Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama, and was immediately engaged to reprise the work with them in New York that April. The same year he made a jazz arrangement of Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 9, Jeunehomme, for Scottish National Jazz Orchestra, with which he performed the World Premiere. He also appeared with NDR Radiophilharmonie, San Francisco Symphony, and São Paulo Symphony Orchestra. He also toured Japan with his big band, No Name Horses, and celebrated its tenth anniversary with a new recording.</h4>
